# Iverilog Flow

- This **Design Flow** includes Simulation and WaveForm Visualization
  - simulation is using iverilog
  - waveform visualization is using GTKWave form

## Setup the Verilog Design Flow

- install Make     -> to check run `make -v`
- install iverilog -> to check run `iverilog -v`
- install GTKWave  -> to check run `gtkwave -v`
